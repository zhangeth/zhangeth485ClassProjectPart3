# Class Project: Part 2

This repo is the base codes of the ClassProject of 2023Spring CSCI485.

## Getting Started
You need to copy and paste the code of Part 1 to this project. 
Your codes need to be put under `src/CSCI485ClassProject/` and its subdirectories. 
Once finished, you can verify it by running the unit test of Part1.

## Project Structure Overview

- `lib`: the dependencies of the project
- `src`: the source codes of the project
  - `CSCI485ClassProject`: root package of the project
    - `models`: package storing some defined representations of models in the database.
    - `test`: package for unit tests
    
## Codes to implement
Under `src/CSCI485ClassProject`, there are 2 classes to finish:
- `Cursor`: `Cursor` implementation
- `RecordsImpl`: implementation of an interface class `Records`

## Run Tests on macOS/Linux using `make`

If you are developing in `macOS/Linux` environment(recommended), we provide `Makefile` for you to run tests quickly.

To run tests of part1, use command
```shell
make part1Test
```

To run tests of part2, use command
```shell
make part2Test
```

As you may have different project structures, Makefile may not work in your implementation. In this case, you can change the `sources` variable in Makefile accordingly.
